> As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.

All humans need meaning in our lives. It’s not just the icing on the cake, but the main substance itself. In fact, it’s probably the primary element driving our behavior. 

But meaning doesn’t just grow on trees, ready to be plucked whenever we need a bit more. 

Meaning is something we have to create for ourselves, both individually and collectively. 

Meaning looks like something different to different people, and even to ourselves, in different situations, and at different life stages. 

I’ve realized recently, though, that there is a common formula for creating meaning. 

I think we can state it like this:

> Meaning = Group + Values + Development + Skills + Differentiation + Knowledge + Opportunity + Autonomy + Effort  + Results + Recognition + Equity + Leisure

Let me describe what I mean by each link in this chain. 

1. **Group** – Each of us must feel in some way associated with one or more groups of fellow humans. These may consist of people we live with, or work with, or otherwise interact with on a regular basis. But such groups may also consist of more far-flung groups bound together with one another in some definite way. For these larger, more nebulous groups, common cultural artifacts often help to create and maintain group identity and group cohesion, and communicate group values. 

2. **Values** – These are simply the things — qualities, or abilities, or characteristics, or norms, or objects — that are valued by each group. 

3. **Development** – In order to build meaning, individuals and groups need to feel that they are learning, growing and developing, especially in terms of achieving/manifesting their values. 

4. **Skills** – In order to deliver value to a group — in order to be valuable, and to be valued — one must possess some useful skills. 

5. **Differentiation** – We humans like to feel that our skills and contributions are in some way unique, so that our value derives not just from general characteristics shared with many others, but from some that are special to ourselves. 

6. **Knowledge** – By this I mean not just general knowledge, but specific knowledge about one’s situation and environment: tactical knowledge of one's surroundings, if you will. Such knowledge is generally necessary in order to be able to apply skills in a useful manner. 

7. **Opportunity** – One needs an opportunity to be able to deliver value to a group. Windows of opportunity may come and go, depending on any number of factors. 

8. **Autonomy** – Humans do not enjoy feeling like automatons. Given all of the ingredients listed above, they need to feel some degree of freedom in terms of how and when they exercise their skills to deliver value to a group. They also need some freedom to experiment, in order to continue their development. 

9. **Effort** - If an accomplishment does not require some significant effort, then we are not likely to view it as very meaningful. 

10. **Results** – We need to see that the employment of our skills has actually yielded some valuable results. 

11. **Recognition** – We need to receive some recognition from other group members concerning the worth of our efforts. Informal, casual, sincere recognition is often as or more important than formal recognition. 

12. **Equity** – Group contributions and benefits must be fairly distributed; decision-making for the group should be fair and inclusive; group norms should be practiced consistently and, when they are not, enforcement should be even-handed and fair, with graduated sanctions based on frequency and severity of lapses. 

13. **Leisure** – We all need some free time for rest and relaxation and play, and if our results and recognition don’t provide this, then we are likely to wonder if it’s all worth it.  

These are the thirteen components that need to be present to enable individuals to experience meaning in their lives. 

When we take these all together, we can see that *meaning* is a sense that *my group is secure and flourishing* and *my position within the group is secure* and *my contributions to the group are valued*. 

If humans are frustrated in their attempts to build meaning in their lives, because one or more of these components are missing, then they will generally try to form/find new groups with which they can generate meaning for themselves. 

If these efforts are further frustrated, they may become depressed, aggressive, suicidal, and/or addicted to substances that provide them with fleeting sensations of something that feels much like meaning.
