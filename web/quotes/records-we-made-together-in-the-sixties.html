				<blockquote>
					<p>These days most engineers confronted with a displeasing sound reach for the knobs on the console and tweak the high, mid or low frequencies. When that process is inflicted on more and more tracks of a multi-channel recording the sound passes through dozens of transistors, resulting in a narrower, more confined sound. With the added limitations of digital sound, you end up with a bright and shiny, thin and two-dimensional recording. To my ears anyway. </p>

<p>When John [Wood] heard a sound he didn&#8217;t like, he would lift his bulky frame off the chair and lumber down the stairs, muttering all the way. I began to be able to predict whether he was going to try a different microphone, reposition the existing one or shift the offending musician to another part of the studio. When I listen to records we made together in the sixties, I can still hear the air in the studio and the full dimension of the sounds the musicians created for us. I can hear the depth of Nick Drake&#8217;s breath as well as his voice, the grit in the crude strings of Robin Williamson&#8217;s <cite>gimbri</cite> and Dave Mattacks&#8217; drum technique spread out warmly in aural Technicolor across the stereo spectrum. </p>
