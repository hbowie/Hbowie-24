				<h3>&ldquo;Ceremonies are designed to&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>In all cultures, ceremonies are designed to communicate the experience of one group of people to the wider community. When people bury loved ones, when they wed, when they graduate from college, the respective ceremonies communicate something essential to the people who are watching. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The group of people that you would both help feed and help defend&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Two of the behaviors that set early humans apart were the systematic sharing of food and altruistic group defense. Other primates did very little of either but, increasingly, hominids did, and those behaviors set them on an evolutionary path that produced the modern world. The earliest and most basic definition of community &#8211; of tribe &#8211; would be the group of people that you would both help feed and help defend. A society that doesn&#8217;t offer its members the chance to act selflessly in these ways isn&#8217;t a society in any tribal sense of the word; it&#8217;s just a political entity that, lacking enemies, will probably fall apart on its own. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Individualized lifestyles deeply brutalizing to the human spirit&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Most primates, including humans, are intensely social, and there are very few instances of lone primates surviving in the wild. A modern soldier returning from combat &#8211; or a survivor of Sarajevo &#8211; goes from the kind of close-knit group that humans evolved for, back into a society where most people work outside the home, children are educated by strangers, families are isolated from wider communities, and personal gain almost completely eclipses collective good. Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything collectively. Whatever the technological advances of modern society &#8211; and they&#8217;re nearly miraculous &#8211; the individualized lifestyles that those technologies spawn seem to be deeply brutalizing to the human spirit. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Social resilience&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Recent studies of something called &#8220;social resilience&#8221; have identified resource sharing and egalitarian wealth distribution as major components of a society&#8217;s ability to recover from hardship. </p>
