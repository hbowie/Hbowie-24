				<h3>&ldquo;That community asks for and gets chaos&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/parenthood.html' rel='tag'>parenthood</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>From the wild Irish slums of the 19th century Eastern seaboard, to the riot-torn suburbs of Los Angeles, there is one unmistakable lesson in American history; a community that allows a large number of men to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any set of rational expectations about the future &#8211; that community asks for and gets chaos. Crime, violence, unrest, disorder &#8211; most particularly the furious, unrestrained lashing out at the whole social structure &#8211; that is not only to be expected; it is very near to inevitable. And it is richly deserved. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Living with the strains of complexity&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Political society wants things simple. Political scientists know them to be complex&#8230; One could argue that, in part, the leftist impulse is so conspicuous among the educated and well-to-do precisely because they are exposed to more information, and are accordingly forced to choose between living with the strains of complexity, or lapsing into simplism. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The institution of the family&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/parenthood.html' rel='tag'>parenthood</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The institution of the family is decisive in determining not only if a person has the capacity to love another individual but in the larger social sense whether he is capable of loving his fellow men collectively. The whole of society rests on this foundation for stability, understanding and social peace. </p>
