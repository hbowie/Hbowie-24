				<h1>My Favorite Things</h1>

<p>Some might protest that &#8220;My Favorite Things&#8221; is not, strictly speaking, a Christmas song. After all, there is no mention of Christmas, and that &#8220;holiday&#8221; word appears nowhere in the lyrics. However, those points notwithstanding, it has been included on many a Christmas album, and it&#8217;s easy to see why: with references to packages, sleigh bells, snowflakes and winters &#8211; as well as the overall theme of &#8220;my favorite things&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s easy to sneak it into any holiday playlist. </p>

<p>The song is by Rodgers and Hammerstein and is, of course, from <em>The Sound of Music</em>. </p>

<p>The lyrics are unusual. Rather than telling a story, or presenting some dramatic conflict, the bulk of the song simply lists &#8220;a few of my favorite things.&#8221; But what things they are! The song grabs us immediately with both the image and the alliteration of &#8220;raindrops on roses&#8221; and then simply doesn&#8217;t let go. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,  <br />
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,  <br />
Brown paper packages tied up with strings,  <br />
These are a few of my favorite things.  </p>

<p>Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels,  <br />
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,  <br />
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings,  <br />
These are a few of my favorite things.  </p>

<p>Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,  <br />
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,  <br />
Silver-white winters that melt into springs,  <br />
These are a few of my favorite things.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, of course, there&#8217;s the reason for the lists. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>When the dog bites,  <br />
When the bee stings,  <br />
When I&#8217;m feeling sad,  <br />
I simply remember my favorite things,  <br />
And then I don&#8217;t feel so bad.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to underestimate the subtle genius of the lyrics. Consider the challenge of calling out fifteen things that every listener would consider genuinely wonderful, yet that wouldn&#8217;t appear mundane. Consider also the wonderfully imaginative use of language, as in &#8220;wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings.&#8221; And consider as well the glorious particularity of many of the images: it&#8217;s not just snow that is wonderful, but &#8220;snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes.&#8221; And, finally, consider the engaging rhythms of the words and music. The first two lines of each verse feature a stop-and-go, halting kind of rhythm that emphasizes the items being identified; the third line then begins to flow more freely, and the fourth line swings and sways on a joyous upward ascent. </p>

<p>My favorite holiday version of this song is the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-favorite-things/706335733?i=706335968" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one by Tony Bennett that appears on his album from 1968, <em>Snowfall: The Tony Bennett Christmas Album</em></a>. I love the swinging big band arrangement, but also Bennett&#8217;s vocals, as he so carefully enunciates each item on the list, managing to give each one a special feel, and actually managing to convince us how much each of these things means to him personally. </p>

<p>Although this is not a song that attempts to overtly strike any deep or spiritual theme, its imaginative list of fifteen achingly appealing and thoroughly worldly items &#8211; all cleverly described as only a <em>few</em> of the singer&#8217;s favorite things &#8211; works for me as an affecting testament to the manifold pleasures of human life on this wonderful planet of ours. This is a fitting theme for me at all times of the year, but seems especially appropriate during the holiday season. </p>
