<p>I have a leadership video I&#8217;d like to share with you. </p>

<p>First, some explanation. Every year at the University of Michigan the students select their favorite professors and present them with a &#8220;Golden Apple Award.&#8221; The recipients are then invited to deliver their &#8220;ideal last lecture.&#8221; </p>

<p>John U. Bacon was a recipient of this award for 2009. Bacon is the co-author, with the late Michigan Football coach Bo Schembechler, of the best-selling business book, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044658200X?ie=UTF8&tag=pagantuna-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=044658200X" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bo&#8217;s Lasting Lessons: The Legendary Coach Teaches the Fundamentals of Leadership</a></cite>. </p>

<p>The video clip I&#8217;d like to share is an excerpt from Bacon&#8217;s Ideal Last Lecture. In it, he recounts a story about Schembechler. Now, if you&#8217;re a fan of Wolverine football, then you probably need no further recommendation. But even if you&#8217;re not, I think it&#8217;s a great leadership tale, and Bacon&#8217;s telling of the story is a work of art all its own. </p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s obvious that many elements of Bo&#8217;s leadership style would not translate well into today&#8217;s corporate environment. For me, though, there are a number of take-aways here that can apply to any leadership role. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Real leadership isn&#8217;t always as neat and clean as it appears to be from the examples found in textbooks.</strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be memorable.</strong> Different leaders will do this in different ways, but if others can&#8217;t remember what you told them, then your leadership probably won&#8217;t be terribly effective. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be real.</strong> Ultimately, as a leader, all you have to offer is yourself, and if you stop short of giving that 100%, then you cheat yourself and those around you. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Talk straight.</strong> Call things as you see them. Others may not agree with you, but it is your being willing to take a position and tell people how you feel that in turn gives others the freedom to agree or disagree. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Always serve a higher cause.</strong> Note that Bo never asked Andy Cannavino to do anything because Bo had directed him to, or because of Bo&#8217;s position of authority: instead, he cited the great Michigan football players who had come before them, and the importance of preserving, respecting and extending that tradition. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on natural consequences.</strong> Again, note that Bo never threatened Cannavino with disciplinary action, or with consequences that would be brought on by Bo or his coaching staff: instead, he talked about the losses their football team would suffer and the sense of responsibility that Cannavino would be left with. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t wait for assurances that others will follow before you begin to lead.</strong> Note that Bo honestly did not know how Cannavino would respond to their confrontation, and that his coaching staff feared that he was provoking an out-and-out mutiny by his players; these factors, however, did not cause Bo the slightest hesitation. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The highest calling for a leader is not to command others, but to awaken others to their own potential for greatness.</strong> Note that Bo never told Cannavino what to do; he never commanded him or directed him to take any specific, finite actions. And the response Bo got from Cannavino was more than he could have directed: instead of compliance, he got a team captain and a defense that was on fire, delivering 24 quarters of football in which not one touchdown was scored against them. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership is sometimes, of necessity, an incendiary act</strong>: acquisition of fuel and construction of the engine are important, but it still takes a spark of ignition to set things in motion. </p></li>
</ol>
