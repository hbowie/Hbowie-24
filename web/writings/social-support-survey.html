<p>This is a simple survey that anyone can use to self-assess the degree of social support they are feeling in their lives. I picked this up from David R. Samson&#8217;s book <em>Our Tribal Future</em>, but he says that he adapted it from other sources. </p>

<p>For each statement below, give yourself a score from 1 - 6, where: </p>
<ul>
<li>1 = Completely unstatisfied / In Disagreement </li>
<li>6 = Completely Satisfied / In Agreement </li>
</ul>
<table>
<tr>
<th>
 Social Support Statement </th>
<th>
 Score </th>
 </tr>
<tr>
<td>
 1. You have someone to count on to distract you from your worries when you feel under stress. </td>
<td>
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
 2. You have someone to really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense. </td>
<td>
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
 3. You have someone who totally accepts you, including both your worst and your best points. </td>
<td>
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
 4. You have someone to really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you. </td>
<td>
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
 5. You have someone whom you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down in the dumps. </td>
<td>
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
 6. You have someone to console you when you are very upset. </td>
<td>
   </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Add up the scores once you have filled out the survey. The average respondent scores about 30, and most people fall within 5 points of that average. </p>
