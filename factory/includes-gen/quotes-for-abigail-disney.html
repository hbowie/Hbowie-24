				<h3>&ldquo;A law against private jets&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/equality.html' rel='tag'>equality</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>If I were queen of the world, I would pass a law against private jets, because they enable you to get around a certain reality. You don&#8217;t have to go through an airport terminal, you don&#8217;t have to interact, you don&#8217;t have to be patient, you don&#8217;t have to be uncomfortable. These are the things that remind us we&#8217;re human. </p>
