				<blockquote>
					<p>The vast majority of difficult, important human problems &#8211; both inside and outside organizations &#8211; are not solved by a swift, decisive stroke from someone at the top. What usually matters are careful, thoughtful, small, practical efforts by people working far from the limelight. </p>
