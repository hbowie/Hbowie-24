				<h3>&ldquo;Cinema was about revelation&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about characters — the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves. </p>
