				<blockquote>
					<p>A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world &#8211; and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity&#8230; has some structure &#8211; it&#8217;s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about, It connects to&#8230; spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to experience of self loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Meaningful Activities&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world—and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity extends across a significant portion of one’s life and has some structure—it’s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about. It often connects to religion and spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to the experience of self-loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous—but none of these additional features are essential. </p>
