				<h3>&ldquo;Social media is hyperactive&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/technology.html' rel='tag'>technology</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The terms social network and social media are used interchangeably now, but they shouldnâ€™t be. A social network is an idle, inactive system &#8211; a Rolodex of contacts, a notebook of sales targets, a yearbook of possible soul mates. But social media is active &#8211; hyperactive, really &#8211; spewing material across those networks instead of leaving them alone until needed. </p>
