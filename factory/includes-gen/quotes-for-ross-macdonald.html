					<p>I had to admit to myself that I lived for nights like these, moving across the city&#8217;s great broken body, making connections among its millions of cells. I had a crazy wish or fantasy that some day before I died, if I made all the right neural connections, the city would come all the way alive. Like the Bride of Frankenstein. </p>
