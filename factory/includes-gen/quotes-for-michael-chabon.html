				<h3>&ldquo;A mind is blown&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A mind is blown when something you always feared but knew to be impossible turns out to be true; when the world turns out far vaster, far more marvelous or malevolent than you ever dreamed; when you get proof that everything is connected to everything else, that everything you know is wrong, that you are both the center of the universe and a tiny speck sailing off its nethermost edge. </p>
				</blockquote>
