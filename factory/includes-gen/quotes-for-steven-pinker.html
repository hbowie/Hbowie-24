				<h3>&ldquo;The historical trajectory of violence&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The historical trajectory of violence affects not only how life is lived but how it is understood. What could be more fundamental to our sense of meaning and purpose than a conception of whether the strivings of the human race over long stretches of time have left us better or worse off? How, in particular, are we to make sense of <em>modernity</em> &#8211; of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence. </p>
