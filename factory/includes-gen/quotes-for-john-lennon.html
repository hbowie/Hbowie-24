					<p>For our last number, I&#8217;d like to ask your help. Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands. And the rest of you, if you&#8217;ll just rattle your jewelry. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;More Popular than Jesus&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn&#8217;t argue about that; I&#8217;m right and I&#8217;ll be proved right. We&#8217;re more popular than Jesus now; I don&#8217;t know which will go first—rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It&#8217;s them twisting it that ruins it for me. </p>
