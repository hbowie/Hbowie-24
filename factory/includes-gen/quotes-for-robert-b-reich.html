				<h3>&ldquo;Public morality&rdquo;</h3>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Moral guidance about what is right or decent can be found both in religious teachings and in our contemporary understanding of what we owe one another as members of the same society. As I have suggested, they overlap. A public morality that protects our democratic institutions, cherishes the truth, accepts our differences, ensures equal rights and equal opportunity, and invites passionate enagement in our civic life gives our own lives deeper meaning. It enlarges our capacities for attachment and love. It informs our sense of honor and shame. It equips us to be virtuous citizens. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Public Truth&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Reviving the common good also depends on each of us taking responsibility for finding, sharing, and insisting upon public truth. By public truth I mean facts about what is happening around us that could affect our well-being, as well as clear logic about the significance of those facts and reasoned analysis about their practical consequences. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;To differentiate truth from falsehood&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>It is the civic responsibility of all of us to check the facts we read or hear, to find and depend upon reliable sources, to share the truth with others, and hold accountable those who lie to us or suppress the truth. </p>

<p>We must also ensure that every American has sufficient education to differentiate truth from falsehood, and to think critically about what they read and see. </p>
