				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Before I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didnâ€™t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder. All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people. </p>
