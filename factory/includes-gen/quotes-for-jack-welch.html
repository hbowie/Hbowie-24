				<h3>&ldquo;Shareholder Value&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/value-creation.html' rel='tag'>value creation</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy&#8230; your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products. Managers and investors should not set share price increases as their overarching goal. &#8230; Short-term profits should be allied with an increase in the long-term value of a company. </p>
