					<p>I consider myself a realist. I have certainly seen my share of the world as it really is and not how I wish it would be. What I&#8217;ve learned is that it is foolish to view realism and idealism as incompatible or to consider our power and wealth as encumbered by the demands of justice, morality and conscience. </p>
