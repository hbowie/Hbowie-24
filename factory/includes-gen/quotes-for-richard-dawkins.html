				<h3>&ldquo;Evolutionary Drive Towards Complexity&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/evolution.html' rel='tag'>evolution</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The evolutionary drive towards complexity comes, in those lineages where it comes at all, not from any inherent propensity for increased complexity, and not from biased mutation. It comes from natural selection: the process which, as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. </p>
