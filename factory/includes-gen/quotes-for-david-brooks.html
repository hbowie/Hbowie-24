				<blockquote>
					<p>Human development research offers a different formula: All of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base. If government can create a framework in which people grow up amid healthy families, nurturing schools, thick communities and a secure safety net, then they will have the resources and audacity to thrive in a free global economy and a diversifying skills economy. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Life is more like settling a sequence of villages&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>

				<h3>&ldquo;No Philosophy of Family Life&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>In other words, while social conservatives have a philosophy of family life they can’t operationalize, because it no longer is relevant, progressives have no philosophy of family life at all, because they don’t want to seem judgmental. The sexual revolution has come and gone, and it’s left us with no governing norms of family life, no guiding values, no articulated ideals. On this most central issue, our shared culture often has nothing relevant to say—and so for decades things have been falling apart. </p>
