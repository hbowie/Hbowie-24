				<h3>&ldquo;When you can measure what you are speaking about&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of <em>science</em>, whatever the matter may be. </p>
				</blockquote>
