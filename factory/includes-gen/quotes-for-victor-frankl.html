				<h3>&ldquo;Each man is questioned by life&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/mission.html' rel='tag'>mission</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Love is the ultimate and the highest goal&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/love.html' rel='tag'>love</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth &#8211; that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. </p>
