				<h3>&ldquo;Preparing Managers to Manage&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The time has come to recognize that higher education in management rests on a fatal fallacy. The idea behind the contemporary business school is that preparing future business managers means training them in a discipline called Business Management. After 100 years of fruitless attempts to produce such a discipline, it should be clear that it does not exist. Preparing managers to manage, in fact, is not different from preparing people to live in a civilized world. Managers do not need to be trained; they need to be <em>educated.</em> And for that purpose, although a certain amount of study of business-related subjects may prove useful, the business schools as they are presently constituted are at best superfluous. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Relieving Ignorance&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;Customer satisfaction&#8221; is a good way to sell shoes; but it is a bad way to relieve ignorance. It is fundamentally stupid to base the content of an education on what the as-yet uneducated person decides is best. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;A Work Ethic Gone Mad&rdquo;</h3>
		
				<p><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/balance.html' rel='tag'>balance</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/mission.html' rel='tag'>mission</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/value-creation.html' rel='tag'>value creation</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The blend of corporate mysticism and transcendental consumerism he [Tom Peters] offers has its roots planted in the pragmatic, optimistic, can-do American work ethic. But, like the Taylorist philosophy from which it springs, it is also a work ethic gone mad. It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work. It becomes a deluded form of optimism, a feverish activity that masks an underlying anxiety about the meaning of life, a form of self-alienation so complete that the self disappears entirely into its consumer preferences and transactions. </p>
